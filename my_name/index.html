  <p><br>
Hi, my name is Pablo Sepulveda. I studied music in college. 
I now work primarily as an interpreter and translator and in Social Media communications.
<br>
    <br>
Many years ago I tried working as a musician and I could not make a living, so I started working as a freelance interpreter and
 translator.
This paid the bills for many years, and when the pandemic happened,
 I found myself with no work for almost 1 year.
  During that time I started
 studying computers and programming at Nort Seattle College.
  I wanted to have more secure job. Last year I took a job working in Social Media.
<br>
    <br>
I can now combine my knowledge of music, coding, computers and translation, and I can provide unique services such as video dubbing and website translation.
<br>
    <br>
I enjoy learning. I would like to learn more about coding and how to make websites to be able to make my own website and sell services online. <br> <br>
